   since version 4.9.  Previous versions do not provide generic
   selection, even though they might set __STDC_VERSION__ to 201112L,
   when in -std=c11 mode.  Thus, we must check for !defined __GNUC__
   when testing __STDC_VERSION__ for generic selection support.
   On the other hand, Clang also defines __GNUC__, so a clang-specific
   check is required to enable the use of generic selection.  *//* __glibc_macro_warning (MESSAGE) issues warning MESSAGE.  This is
   intended for use in preprocessor macros.

   Note: MESSAGE must be a _single_ string; concatenation of string
   literals is not supported.  *//* Copies attributes from the declaration or type referenced by
   the argument.  *//* Undefine (also defined in libc-symbols.h).  *//* Describes a char array whose address can safely be passed as the first
   argument to strncpy and strncat, as the char array is not necessarily
   a NUL-terminated string.  *//* Not supported.  *//* Some other non-C99 compiler.  *//* Not supported in old GCC.  *//* ISO C99 also allows to declare arrays as non-overlapping.  The syntax is
     array_name[restrict]
   GCC 3.1 supports this.  *//* Ignore *//* __restrict is known in EGCS 1.2 and above. *//* It is possible to compile containing GCC extensions even if GCC is
   run in pedantic mode if the uses are carefully marked using the
   `__extension__' keyword.  But this is not generally available before
   version 2.8.  *//* GCC 4.3 and above allow passing all anonymous arguments of an
   __extern_always_inline function to some other vararg function.  *//* GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
   inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  Using __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__
   or __GNUC_GNU_INLINE is not a good enough check for gcc because gcc versions
   older than 4.3 may define these macros and still not guarantee GNU inlining
   semantics.

   clang++ identifies itself as gcc-4.2, but has support for GNU inlining
   semantics, that can be checked for by using the __GNUC_STDC_INLINE_ and
   __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ macro definitions.  *//* Associate error messages with the source location of the call site rather
   than with the source location inside the function.  *//* The Linux kernel defines __always_inline in stddef.h (283d7573), and
   it conflicts with this definition.  Therefore undefine it first to
   allow either header to be included first.  *//* Forces a function to be always inlined.  *//* empty *//* If fortification mode, we warn about unused results of certain
   function calls which can lead to problems.  *//* The nonull function attribute allows to mark pointer parameters which
   must not be NULL.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.97 development the `strfmon' format
   attribute for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it
   unconditionally (although this would be possible) since it
   generates warnings.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.8 development the `format_arg' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.
   If several `format_arg' attributes are given for the same function, in
   gcc-3.0 and older, all but the last one are ignored.  In newer gccs,
   all designated arguments are considered.  *//* Since version 4.5, gcc also allows one to specify the message printed
   when a deprecated function is used.  clang claims to be gcc 4.2, but
   may also support this feature.  *//* Since version 3.2, gcc allows marking deprecated functions.  *//* At some point during the gcc 3.1 development the `used' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* This declaration tells the compiler that the value is constant.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `pure' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* Ignore.  *//* Tell the compiler which arguments to an allocation function
   indicate the size of the allocation.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `malloc' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* GCC has various useful declarations that can be made with the
   `__attribute__' syntax.  All of the ways we use this do fine if
   they are omitted for compilers that don't understand it. *//*
#elif __SOME_OTHER_COMPILER__

# define __REDIRECT(name, proto, alias) name proto; \
	_Pragma("let " #name " = " #alias)
*//* __asm__ ("xyz") is used throughout the headers to rename functions
   at the assembly language level.  This is wrapped by the __REDIRECT
   macro, in order to support compilers that can do this some other
   way.  When compilers don't support asm-names at all, we have to do
   preprocessor tricks instead (which don't have exactly the right
   semantics, but it's the best we can do).

   Example:
   int __REDIRECT(setpgrp, (__pid_t pid, __pid_t pgrp), setpgid); *//* Some other non-C99 compiler.  Approximate with [1].  *//* Pre-2.97 GCC did not support C99 flexible arrays but did have
   an equivalent extension with slightly different notation.  *//* GCC 2.97 supports C99 flexible array members as an extension,
   even when in C89 mode or compiling C++ (any version).  *//* Support for flexible arrays.
   Headers that should use flexible arrays only if they're "real"
   (e.g. only if they won't affect sizeof()) should test
   #if __glibc_c99_flexarr_available.  *//* Fortify support.  *//* C++ needs to know that types and declarations are C, not C++.  *//* This is not a typedef so `const __ptr_t' does the right thing.  *//* For these things, GCC behaves the ANSI way normally,
   and the non-ANSI way under -traditional.  *//* These two macros are not used in glibc anymore.  They are kept here
   only because some other projects expect the macros to be defined.  *//* Compilers that are not clang may object to
       #if defined __clang__ && __has_extension(...)
   even though they do not need to evaluate the right-hand side of the &&.  *//* GCC.  *//* No inline functions.  *//* Not GCC.  *//* GCC can always grok prototypes.  For C++ programs we add throw()
   to help it optimize the function calls.  But this works only with
   gcc 2.8.x and egcs.  For gcc 3.2 and up we even mark C functions
   as non-throwing using a function attribute since programs can use
   the -fexceptions options for C code as well.  *//* All functions, except those with callbacks or those that
   synchronize memory, are leaf functions.  *//* Some user header file might have defined this before.  *//* The GNU libc does not support any K&R compilers or the traditional mode
   of ISO C compilers anymore.  Check for some of the combinations not
   anymore supported.  *//* We are almost always included from features.h. *//* Copyright (C) 1992-2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

   __GLIBC_MINOR__ now (see below) when you want to test for a specific

   defines %a as a standalone format specifier that reads a floating-
   point number; moreover, POSIX.1-2008 provides the same feature
   using the modifier letter 'm' instead (%ms, %mS, %m[...]).

   We now follow C99 unless GNU extensions are active and the compiler
   is specifically in C89 or C++98 mode (strict or not).  For
   instance, with GCC, -std=gnu11 will have C99-compliant scanf with
   or without -D_GNU_SOURCE, but -std=c89 -D_GNU_SOURCE will have the
   old extension.  *//* The function 'gets' existed in C89, but is impossible to use
   safely.  It has been removed from ISO C11 and ISO C++14.  Note: for
   compatibility with various implementations of <cstdio>, this test
   must consider only the value of __cplusplus when compiling C++.  *//* Some C libraries once required _REENTRANT and/or _THREAD_SAFE to be
   defined in all multithreaded code.  GNU libc has not required this
   for many years.  We now treat them as compatibility synonyms for
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L, which is the earliest level of POSIX with
   comprehensive support for multithreaded code.  Using them never
   lowers the selected level of POSIX conformance, only raises it.  *//* If none of the ANSI/POSIX macros are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE
   is defined, use POSIX.1-2008 (or another version depending on
   _XOPEN_SOURCE).  *//* This is to enable compatibility for ISO C++11.
   Check the temporary macro for now, too.  *//* This is to enable compatibility for ISO C++17.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C90 Amendment 1:1995 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C99 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C11 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C2X extension.  *//* If nothing (other than _GNU_SOURCE and _DEFAULT_SOURCE) is defined,

   transitioned to use the new macro.  *//* Whether to use feature set F.  *//* Similarly for clang.  Features added to GCC after version 4.2 may
   or may not also be available in clang, and clang's definitions of
   __GNUC(_MINOR)__ are fixed at 4 and 2 respectively.  Not all such
   features can be queried via __has_extension/__has_feature.  *//* Convenience macro to test the version of gcc.

   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
			__STRICT_ANSI__).

   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	Add security hardening to many library functions.
			Set to 1 or 2; 2 performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  *//usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/c++/9/bits/os_defines.h<features.h>_GLIBCXX_NO_OBSOLETE_ISINF_ISNAN_DYNAMIC__GLIBC_PREREQ(2,23)_GLIBCXX_HAVE_GETS__NO_CTYPE_GLIBCXX_OS_DEFINES__GLIBC_PREREQ(2,15) && defined(_GNU_SOURCE)15// version dynamically in case it has changed since libstdc++ was configured.// Glibc 2.23 removed the obsolete isinf and isnan declarations.

   ensures that the type is correct; it is necessary to use (L'\0' +
   0) rather than just L'\0' so that the type in C++ is the promoted
   version of wchar_t rather than the distinct wchar_t type itself.
   Because wchar_t in preprocessor #if expressions is treated as
   intmax_t or uintmax_t, the expression (L'\0' - 1) would have the
   wrong value for WCHAR_MAX in such expressions and so cannot be used

   *  @defgroup io I/O
   *
   *  Nearly all of the I/O classes are parameterized on the type of
   *  characters they read and write.  (The major exception is ios_base at
   *  the top of the hierarchy.)  This is a change from pre-Standard
   *  streams, which were not templates.
   *
   *  For ease of use and compatibility, all of the basic_* I/O-related
   *  classes are given typedef names for both of the builtin character
   *  widths (wide and narrow).  The typedefs are the same as the
   *  pre-Standard names, for example:
   *
   *  @code
   *     typedef basic_ifstream<char>  ifstream;
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  Because properly forward-declaring these classes can be difficult, you
   *  should not do it yourself.  Instead, include the &lt;iosfwd&gt;
   *  header, which contains only declarations of all the I/O classes as
   *  well as the typedefs.  Trying to forward-declare the typedefs
   *  themselves (e.g., <code>class ostream;</code>) is not valid ISO C++.
   *
   *  For more specific declarations, see
   *  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/io.html#std.io.objects

   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  *//* Largest integral types.  *//* quad_t is also 64 bits.  *//* Smallest types with at least a given width.  *//* Fixed-size types, underlying types depend on word size and compiler.  *//* Convenience types.  *//*
 * Never include this file directly; use <sys/types.h> instead.
 *//* bits/types.h -- definitions of __*_t types underlying *_t types.

   The declarations here must match those in localeinfo.h.

   In the thread-specific locale model (see `uselocale' in <locale.h>)
   we cannot use global variables for these as was done in the past.
   Instead, the following accessor functions return the address of
   each variable, which is local to the current thread if multithreaded.

   These point into arrays of 384, so they can be indexed by any `unsigned
   char' value [0,255]; by EOF (-1); or by any `signed char' value
   [-128,-1).  ISO C requires that the ctype functions work for `unsigned
   char' values and for EOF; we also support negative `signed char' values
   for broken old programs.  The case conversion arrays are of `int's
   rather than `unsigned char's because tolower (EOF) must be EOF, which
   doesn't fit into an `unsigned char'.  But today more important is that
   the arrays are also used for multi-byte character sets.  *//* ! _ISbit  *//* Alphanumeric.  *//* Punctuation.  *//* Control character.  *//* Blank (usually SPC and TAB).  *//* Graphical.  *//* Printing.  *//* Whitespace.  *//* Hexadecimal numeric.  *//* Numeric.  *//* Alphabetic.  *//* lowercase.  *//* UPPERCASE.  *//* __BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN *//* These are all the characteristics of characters.
   If there get to be more than 16 distinct characteristics,
   many things must be changed that use `unsigned short int's.

   The characteristics are stored always in network byte order (big
   endian).  We define the bit value interpretations here dependent on the
   machine's byte order.  *//*

pthread.h *//* Optimizations.  *//* Install handlers to be called when a new process is created with FORK.
   The PREPARE handler is called in the parent process just before performing
   FORK. The PARENT handler is called in the parent process just after FORK.
   The CHILD handler is called in the child process.  Each of the three
   handlers can be NULL, meaning that no handler needs to be called at that
   point.
   PTHREAD_ATFORK can be called several times, in which case the PREPARE
   handlers are called in LIFO order (last added with PTHREAD_ATFORK,
   first called before FORK), and the PARENT and CHILD handlers are called
   in FIFO (first added, first called).  *//* Get ID of CPU-time clock for thread THREAD_ID.  *//* Store POINTER in the thread-specific data slot identified by KEY. *//* Return current value of the thread-specific data slot identified by KEY.  *//* Destroy KEY.  *//* Create a key value identifying a location in the thread-specific

   when the thread is canceled or calls pthread_exit.  ROUTINE will also

   pthread_cleanup_push and pthread_cleanup_pop are macros and must always
   be used in matching pairs at the same nesting level of braces.  *//* Function called to call the cleanup handler.  As an extern inline

   Note that these functions are explicitly not marked to not throw an

   this is necessary to have the compiler generate the unwind information.  *//* Guarantee that the initialization function INIT_ROUTINE will be called
   only once, even if pthread_once is executed several times with the
   same ONCE_CONTROL argument. ONCE_CONTROL must point to a static or
   extern variable initialized to PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT.

   The initialization functions might throw exception which is why
   this function is not marked with __THROW.  *//* Functions for handling initialization.  *//* Get bit set in CPUSET representing the processors TH can run on.  *//* Limit specified thread TH to run only on the processors represented
   in CPUSET.  *//* Yield the processor to another thread or process.

   to be started.  This size must never be less than PTHREAD_STACK_MIN
   and must also not exceed the system limits.  *//* Return the currently used minimal stack size.  *//* Set the starting address of the stack of the thread to be created.
   Depending on whether the stack grows up or down the value must either
   be higher or lower than all the address in the memory block.  The
   minimal size of the block must be PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.  *//* Set scheduling contention scope in *ATTR according to SCOPE.  *//* Return in *SCOPE the scheduling contention scope of *ATTR.  *//* Set scheduling inheritance mode in *ATTR according to INHERIT.  *//* Return in *INHERIT the scheduling inheritance mode of *ATTR.  *//* Set scheduling policy in *ATTR according to POLICY.  *//* Return in *POLICY the scheduling policy of *ATTR.  *//* Set scheduling parameters (priority, etc) in *ATTR according to PARAM.  *//* Return in *PARAM the scheduling parameters of *ATTR.  *//* Set the size of the guard area created for stack overflow protection.  *//* Get the size of the guard area created for stack overflow protection.  *//* Set detach state attribute.  *//* Get detach state attribute.  *//* Destroy thread attribute *ATTR.  *//* Initialize thread attribute *ATTR with default attributes

   The resources of TH will therefore be freed immediately when it
   terminates, instead of waiting for another thread to perform PTHREAD_JOIN
   on it.  *//* Make calling thread wait for termination of the thread TH, but only
   until TIMEOUT measured against the clock specified by CLOCKID.  The
   exit status of the thread is stored in *THREAD_RETURN, if
   THREAD_RETURN is not NULL.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Make calling thread wait for termination of the thread TH, but only
   until TIMEOUT.  The exit status of the thread is stored in
   *THREAD_RETURN, if THREAD_RETURN is not NULL.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Check whether thread TH has terminated.  If yes return the status of

   calls in shared flavors of the HP-UX C library.  Most of the stubs
   have no functionality.  The details are described in the "libc cumulative
   patch" for each subversion of HP-UX 11.  There are two special interfaces
   provided for checking whether an application is linked to a shared pthread
   library or not.  However, these interfaces aren't available in early
   libpthread libraries.  We also need a test that works for archive
   libraries.  We can't use pthread_once as some libc versions call the
   init function.  We also can't use pthread_create or pthread_attr_init
   as these create a thread and thereby prevent changing the default stack
   size.  The function pthread_default_stacksize_np is available in both
   the archive and shared versions of libpthread.   It can be used to
   determine the default pthread stack size.  There is a stub in some
   shared libc versions which returns a zero size if pthreads are not
   active.  We provide an equivalent stub to handle cases where libc
   doesn't provide one.  *//* not __GXX_WEAK__ *//* FreeBSD or Solaris *//* For a program to be multi-threaded the only thing that it certainly must
   be using is pthread_create.  However, there may be other libraries that
   intercept pthread_create with their own definitions to wrap pthreads
   functionality for some purpose.  In those cases, pthread_create being
   defined might not necessarily mean that libpthread is actually linked
   in.

   For the GNU C library, we can use a known internal name.  This is always
   available in the ABI, but no other library would define it.  That is
   ideal, since any public pthread function might be intercepted just as
   pthread_create might be.  __pthread_key_create is an "internal"
   implementation symbol, but it is part of the public exported ABI.  Also,
   it's among the symbols that the static libpthread.a always links in
   whenever pthread_create is used, so there is no danger of a false
   negative result in any statically-linked, multi-threaded program.

   For others, we choose pthread_cancel as a function that seems unlikely
   to be redefined by an interceptor library.  The bionic (Android) C
   library does not provide pthread_cancel, so we do use pthread_create
   there (and interceptor libraries lose).  *//* neither FreeBSD nor Solaris *//* Make sure we'll never enter this block again.  *//* If this really is a threaded program, then we must ensure that
	     __gthread_active has been set to 1 before exiting this block.  *//* This test is not protected to avoid taking a lock on the main code
     path so every update of __gthread_active in a threaded program must
     be atomic with regard to the result of the test.  *//* On Solaris 2.6 up to 9, the libc exposes a POSIX threads interface even if
   -pthreads is not specified.  The functions are dummies and most return an
   error value.  However pthread_once returns 0 without invoking the routine
   it is passed so we cannot pretend that the interface is active if -pthreads
   is not specified.  On Solaris 2.5.1, the interface is not exposed at all so
   we need to play the usual game with weak symbols.  On Solaris 10 and up, a
   working interface is always exposed.  On FreeBSD 6 and later, libc also
   exposes a dummy POSIX threads interface, similar to what Solaris 2.6 up
   to 9 does.  FreeBSD >= 700014 even provides a pthread_cancel stub in libc,

       #define __GTHREADS 1
   to indicate that threads support is present.  Also it has define
   function
     int __gthread_active_p ()
   that returns 1 if thread system is active, 0 if not.

   The threads interface must define the following types:
     __gthread_key_t
     __gthread_once_t
     __gthread_mutex_t
     __gthread_recursive_mutex_t

   The threads interface must define the following macros:

     __GTHREAD_ONCE_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_once_t
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
		Define this to a function which looks like this:
		  void __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION (__gthread_mutex_t *)
     		Some systems can't initialize a mutex without a
		function call.  Don't define __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT in this case.
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
     		as above, but for a recursive mutex.

   The threads interface must define the following static functions:

     int __gthread_once (__gthread_once_t *once, void (*func) ())

     int __gthread_key_create (__gthread_key_t *keyp, void (*dtor) (void *))
     int __gthread_key_delete (__gthread_key_t key)

     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_trylock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_unlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   The following are supported in POSIX threads only. They are required to
   fix a deadlock in static initialization inside libsupc++. The header file
   gthr-posix.h defines a symbol __GTHREAD_HAS_COND to signify that these extra
   features are supported.

   Types:
     __gthread_cond_t

   Macros:
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT_FUNCTION

   Interface:
     int __gthread_cond_broadcast (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_wait (__gthread_cond_t *cond, __gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_cond_wait_recursive (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
					__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   All functions returning int should return zero on success or the error
   number.  If the operation is not supported, -1 is returned.

   If the following are also defined, you should
     #define __GTHREADS_CXX0X 1
   to enable the c++0x thread library.

   *  Binders turn functions/functors with two arguments into functors
   *  with a single argument, storing an argument to be applied later.
   *  For example, a variable @c B of type @c binder1st is constructed
   *  from a functor @c f and an argument @c x. Later, B's @c
   *  operator() is called with a single argument @c y. The return
   *  value is the value of @c f(x,y). @c B can be @a called with
   *  various arguments (y1, y2, ...) and will in turn call @c
   *  f(x,y1), @c f(x,y2), ...
   *
   *  The function @c bind1st is provided to save some typing. It takes the
   *  function and an argument as parameters, and returns an instance of
   *  @c binder1st.
   *
   *  The type @c binder2nd and its creator function @c bind2nd do the same
   *  thing, but the stored argument is passed as the second parameter instead
   *  of the first, e.g., @c bind2nd(std::minus<float>(),1.3) will create a
   *  functor whose @c operator() accepts a floating-point number, subtracts
   *  1.3 from it, and returns the result. (If @c bind1st had been used,
   *  the functor would perform <em>1.3 - x</em> instead.
   *
   *  Creator-wrapper functions like @c bind1st are intended to be used in
   *  calling algorithms. Their return values will be temporary objects.
   *  (The goal is to not require you to type names like
   *  @c std::binder1st<std::plus<int>> for declaring a variable to hold the
   *  return value from @c bind1st(std::plus<int>(),5).
   *
   *  These become more useful when combined with the composition functions.
   *
   *  These functions are deprecated in C++11 and can be replaced by
   *  @c std::bind (or @c std::tr1::bind) which is more powerful and flexible,
   *  supporting functions with any number of arguments.  Uses of @c bind1st
   *  can be replaced by @c std::bind(f, x, std::placeholders::_1) and
   *  @c bind2nd by @c std::bind(f, std::placeholders::_1, x).

   * @ingroup functors
   *
   *  The advantage of function objects over pointers to functions is that
   *  the objects in the standard library declare nested typedefs describing
   *  their argument and result types with uniform names (e.g., @c result_type
   *  from the base classes @c unary_function and @c binary_function).
   *  Sometimes those typedefs are required, not just optional.
   *
   *  Adaptors are provided to turn pointers to unary (single-argument) and
   *  binary (double-argument) functions into function objects.  The
   *  long-winded functor @c pointer_to_unary_function is constructed with a
   *  function pointer @c f, and its @c operator() called with argument @c x
   *  returns @c f(x).  The functor @c pointer_to_binary_function does the same
   *  thing, but with a double-argument @c f and @c operator().
   *
   *  The function @c ptr_fun takes a pointer-to-function @c f and constructs
   *  an instance of the appropriate functor.

   *
   *  The functions @c not1 and @c not2 each take a predicate functor
   *  and return an instance of @c unary_negate or
   *  @c binary_negate, respectively.  These classes are functors whose
   *  @c operator() performs the stored predicate function and then returns
   *  the negation of the result.
   *
   *  For example, given a vector of integers and a trivial predicate,
   *  \code
   *  struct IntGreaterThanThree
   *    : public std::unary_function<int, bool>

   *  The call to @c find_if will locate the first index (i) of @c v for which
   *  <code>!(v[i] > 3)</code> is true.

   *  The not1/unary_negate combination works on predicates taking a single

   *  the library provides functors for those operations.  See the
   *  documentation for @link functors the base classes@endlink
   *  for examples of their use.
   *
   *  @{
   */// 20.3.2 arithmetic/// @c result_type is the return type/// @c second_argument_type is the type of the second argument/// @c first_argument_type is the type of the first argument/**
   *  This is one of the @link functors functor base classes@endlink.
   *//// @c argument_type is the type of the argument/** @defgroup functors Function Objects
   * @ingroup utilities
   *
   *  Function objects, or @e functors, are objects with an @c operator()
   *  defined and accessible.  They can be passed as arguments to algorithm
   *  templates and used in place of a function pointer.  Not only is the
   *  resulting expressiveness of the library increased, but the generated
   *  code can be more efficient than what you might write by hand.  When we
   *  refer to @a functors, then, generally we include function pointers in
   *  the description as well.
   *
   *  Often, functors are only created as temporaries passed to algorithm
   *  calls, rather than being created as named variables.
   *
   *  Two examples taken from the standard itself follow.  To perform a
   *  by-element addition of two vectors @c a and @c b containing @c double,
   *  and put the result in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform (a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), a.begin(), plus<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  To negate every element in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform(a.begin(), a.end(), a.begin(), negate<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  The addition and negation functions will be inlined directly.
   *
   *  The standard functors are derived from structs named @c unary_function
   *  and @c binary_function.  These two classes contain nothing but typedefs,
   *  to aid in generic (template) programming.  If you write your own
   *  functors, you might consider doing the same.

   *  Nathan Myers <ncm@cantrip.org>.
   *
   *  A string looks like this:
   *
   *  @code
   *                                        [_Rep]
   *                                        _M_length
   *   [basic_string<char_type>]            _M_capacity
   *   _M_dataplus                          _M_refcount
   *   _M_p ---------------->               unnamed array of char_type
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  Where the _M_p points to the first character in the string, and
   *  you cast it to a pointer-to-_Rep and subtract 1 to get a
   *  pointer to the header.
   *
   *  This approach has the enormous advantage that a string object
   *  requires only one allocation.  All the ugliness is confined
   *  within a single %pair of inline functions, which each compile to
   *  a single @a add instruction: _Rep::_M_data(), and
   *  string::_M_rep(); and the allocation function which gets a
   *  block of raw bytes and with room enough and constructs a _Rep
   *  object at the front.
   *
   *  The reason you want _M_data pointing to the character %array and
   *  not the _Rep is so that the debugger can see the string
   *  contents. (Probably we should add a non-inline member to get
   *  the _Rep for the debugger to use, so users can check the actual
   *  string length.)
   *
   *  Note that the _Rep object is a POD so that you can have a
   *  static <em>empty string</em> _Rep object already @a constructed before
   *  static constructors have run.  The reference-count encoding is
   *  chosen so that a 0 indicates one reference, so you never try to
   *  destroy the empty-string _Rep object.
   *
   *  All but the last paragraph is considered pretty conventional
   *  for a C++ string implementation.

   *
   *  This is a base class.  Derived stream buffers each control a
   *  pair of character sequences:  one for input, and one for output.
   *
   *  Section [27.5.1] of the standard describes the requirements and
   *  behavior of stream buffer classes.  That section (three paragraphs)
   *  is reproduced here, for simplicity and accuracy.
   *
   *  -# Stream buffers can impose various constraints on the sequences
   *     they control.  Some constraints are:
   *     - The controlled input sequence can be not readable.
   *     - The controlled output sequence can be not writable.
   *     - The controlled sequences can be associated with the contents of
   *       other representations for character sequences, such as external
   *       files.
   *     - The controlled sequences can support operations @e directly to or
   *       from associated sequences.
   *     - The controlled sequences can impose limitations on how the
   *       program can read characters from a sequence, write characters to
   *       a sequence, put characters back into an input sequence, or alter
   *       the stream position.
   *     .
   *  -# Each sequence is characterized by three pointers which, if non-null,
   *     all point into the same @c charT array object.  The array object
   *     represents, at any moment, a (sub)sequence of characters from the
   *     sequence.  Operations performed on a sequence alter the values
   *     stored in these pointers, perform reads and writes directly to or
   *     from associated sequences, and alter <em>the stream position</em> and
   *     conversion state as needed to maintain this subsequence relationship.
   *     The three pointers are:
   *     - the <em>beginning pointer</em>, or lowest element address in the
   *       array (called @e xbeg here);
   *     - the <em>next pointer</em>, or next element address that is a
   *       current candidate for reading or writing (called @e xnext here);
   *     - the <em>end pointer</em>, or first element address beyond the
   *       end of the array (called @e xend here).
   *     .
   *  -# The following semantic constraints shall always apply for any set
   *     of three pointers for a sequence, using the pointer names given
   *     immediately above:
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer, then @e xbeg and @e xend shall
   *       also be non-null pointers into the same @c charT array, as
   *       described above; otherwise, @e xbeg and @e xend shall also be null.
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xnext < @e xend for an
   *       output sequence, then a <em>write position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e *xnext shall be assignable as the next element
   *       to write (to put, or to store a character value, into the sequence).
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xbeg < @e xnext for an
   *       input sequence, then a <em>putback position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e xnext[-1] shall have a defined value and is the
   *       next (preceding) element to store a character that is put back
   *       into the input sequence.
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xnext< @e xend for an
   *       input sequence, then a <em>read position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e *xnext shall have a defined value and is the
   *       next element to read (to get, or to obtain a character value,
   *       from the sequence).

       *
       *  The basic format is affected by the value of io.flags() &

       *  printf %f specifier.  Else if equal to ios_base::scientific, formats
       *  like %e or %E with ios_base::uppercase unset or set respectively.
       *  Otherwise, formats like %g or %G depending on uppercase.  Note that
       *  if both fixed and scientific are set, the effect will also be like
       *  %g or %G.
       *
       *  The output precision is given by io.precision().  This precision is
       *  capped at numeric_limits::digits10 + 2 (different for double and

       *  @param  __sb  A pointer to a streambuf
       *
       *  This function behaves like one of the basic arithmetic extractors,
       *  in that it also constructs a sentry object and has the same error
       *  handling behavior.
       *
       *  If @p __sb is NULL, the stream will set failbit in its error state.
       *
       *  Characters are extracted from this stream and inserted into the
       *  @p __sb streambuf until one of the following occurs:
       *
       *  - the input stream reaches end-of-file,
       *  - insertion into the output buffer fails (in this case, the
       *    character that would have been inserted is not extracted), or
       *  - an exception occurs (and in this case is caught)
       *
       *  If the function inserts no characters, failbit is set.

       *  @name Extractors
       *
       *  All the @c operator>> functions (aka <em>formatted input
       *  functions</em>) have some common behavior.  Each starts by
       *  constructing a temporary object of type std::basic_istream::sentry
       *  with the second argument (noskipws) set to false.  This has several
       *  effects, concluding with the setting of a status flag; see the
       *  sentry documentation for more.
       *
       *  If the sentry status is good, the function tries to extract
       *  whatever data is appropriate for the type of the argument.
       *
       *  If an exception is thrown during extraction, ios_base::badbit
       *  will be turned on in the stream's error state (without causing an
       *  ios_base::failure to be thrown) and the original exception will
       *  be rethrown if badbit is set in the exceptions mask.
      *//**
       *  @brief  Interface for manipulators.
       *
       *  Manipulators such as @c std::ws and @c std::dec use these
       *  functions in constructs like
       *  <code>std::cin >> std::ws</code>.
       *  For more information, see the iomanip header.
